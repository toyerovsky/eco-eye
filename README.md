# EcoEye
To help those people who want to take care of our planet likewise our future and are aware of the problem we created mobile application whose main functionality is to categorize garbage on the base of image recognition. All we need to do is to take a picture of garbage that we would like to classify and we will get a response with information about its material and to which container the waste should be thrown away.
As an additional feature we have appended interesting facts about environmental protection to increase public awareness.
Moreover we added option that enables us to find garbage can on the map, where we have over 50000 places intended to recycle trash.
